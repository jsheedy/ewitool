As EWItool is being independently developed there are some differences between how it works and how the other available EWI patch editors behave.

  * Filter Chain switches - named intuitively:
    * 1-only - Just the primary filter is effective
    * Linked - Both filters work as one (secondary filter settings are meaningless)
    * Both - Primary and Secondary filters work independently
  * Bite Sensor - I think these settings are correctly named in EWItool

EWItool also exposes a number of patch editing parameters which I don't think the current alternative editors provide:

  * Wet/Dry controls for both Delay and Reverb
  * Anti-Alias Filter (on-off, cutoff freq and key follow)

And of course, EWItool is integrated with an on-line EWI Patch Exchange!
