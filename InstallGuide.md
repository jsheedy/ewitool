# Linux #

You will probably need to build EWItool from source.  Please see [Building\_EWItool](Building_EWItool.md) for instructions.  Gentoo ebuilds and Debian (i386 Lenny/Sid) packages are available.

# Windows #

EWItool runs on 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows. It has been used on at least Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 (32 and 64-bit).

EWItool requires some files from a toolkit called Qt to be on your PC.  If you know you have Qt version 4.4 (or later) already installed on your system then you should download just the EWItool-win32-X.Y.zip file.

If you don't think you have the Qt libraries installed on your machine then  DON'T PANIC! You just need to download the "EWItool-win32-Qt-libs" zip file as well as the program zip file and expand (unzip) both of them into the same directory.

The "EWItool-win32-Qt-libs" file will only change very rarely - you will not need to download it every time you upgrade EWItool.

It will be clearly stated in the release notes and change log if new versions of the Qt libs need to be downloaded. There was a change in the required libraries between version 0.6 and 0.7, so you will need to download the Qt libs file again if you do not have a full Qt install on your machine.

Once you have downloaded the correct file(s), simply unzip it/them wherever you like and double-click on the "ewitool" executable to run the program.

Now go to the [Using\_EWItool](Using_EWItool.md) user guide.
