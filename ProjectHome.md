EWItool is an open source controller for the popular Akai **EWI4000s** wind synthesizer.  EWItool includes a fully graphical sound (patch) editor and patch library management.  From version 0.4 onwards there is access to an online patch repository for sharing patches with others.  For details please see [EWIPatchExchange](EWIPatchExchange.md) .

EWItool has been developed by [Steve Merrony](http://www.stephenmerrony.co.uk/) for both Linux and Windows.  Zip files of executables are available for Windows users. Other contributors have provided a Debian package (i386 lenny/sid) and a Gentoo ebuild which are available in the Download section. Debian package sources are also available in the "contrib/debian" SVN folder.

If you download EWItool, **please** provide us with feedback preferably by joining our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/EWItool-Users).
